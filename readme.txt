This Plugin increases your PageSpeed even further. It is optimized to work well with our SV100 Theme.

= Plugin Description =

We do not like multipurpose plugins. However, as a WordPress agency, we regularly develop little helpers that noticeably relieve our everyday life, but would be too small on their own to justify their own plugin.

Our SV100 Companion Plugin offers numerous features that can complement our products, extend or enhance third-party plugins and improve the PageSpeed of your website.

Each feature can be activated individually and is only loaded when needed. We refrain from using jQuery so that the frontend scripts are as small, efficient and fast to load as possible.
